Is a Core Component used often @stealif/sharedArrayBuffer to do Cross Platform Cross Application Interop eg: Browser Extension using nodejs. 
It implements utils to use when you do Component Integration on a lower level. It uses the C Std IO implementation so it works with command lines and fileHandels. 

## Todo
- create contentScript to backgroundScript Generators. 
- create HostScript to contentScript
- offer both with @stealify/sharedArrayBuffer helpers as it is faster to work on sharedMemory.
